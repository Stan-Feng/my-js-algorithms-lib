Data Structure & Algorithms Written in JavaScript
================================================

## Why study algorithms?
- essential for all other branches of computer science further study
- key role in modern technological innovation

#### What should do during learning algorithms
- Mathematical analysis
- Translate them to code

#### Guiding Principles for Analysis of Algorithms
- Worst-case analysis, (average-case analysis & bench marks) require domain knowledge
- Won't pay attention to constant factors, lower-order terms
- Asymptotic analysis: focus on running time for large input size

#### Asymptotic Analysis
- High-level idea:
  - Suppress const and factors (highly depend on env)
  - lower-order terms (increasing relevant) for large input
